# README - My C Code Compilation Instructions

## Description
This repository contains a C program that does [briefly describe what your program does].

## Prerequisites
Before you can compile and run this C program, you'll need the following:

- A C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- An operating system that supports C compilation (e.g., Linux, macOS, Windows with a GCC or MinGW installation)

## Compilation
Follow these steps to compile and run the C program:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory where you have downloaded or cloned this repository using the `cd` command. For example:

    ```
    cd path/to/your/repo
    ```

3. Compile the C program using the following command:

    ```
    gcc -o my_program my_program.c
    ```

    Replace `my_program` with the desired name for your compiled executable and `my_program.c` with the name of your C source code file.

    If you encounter any errors during compilation, please make sure you've installed a C compiler and that your code is free from syntax errors.

4. If the compilation is successful, you can now run the program by executing:

    ```
    ./my_program
    ```

    Replace `my_program` with the name you provided in the compilation step.

## Usage
Explain how to use your program once it's compiled and running.

## Example
Provide an example of how to use your program, including input and expected output.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues or have questions about the program, please feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo/issues) in this repository.
